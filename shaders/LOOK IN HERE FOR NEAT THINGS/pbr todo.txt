TODO: GGX Shading Model for metallic surfaces
TODO: Orenâ€“Nayar for rough surfaces
TODO: Thinking Blinn-Phong for smooth surfaces?
TODO: Accurate Fresnel plox?

FIXME: Fix the damned sunspot for the love of god.
FIXME: Important one here, metals are always reflecting things as if they're gold, they are not using the albedo to determine reflect color.

TODO: Microsurface and energy conservation
TODO: Allow fully transparent surfaces to reflect (only on glass please)
TODO: Would like to improve the quality of the ray tracing, have better falloff toward the tops of blocks
