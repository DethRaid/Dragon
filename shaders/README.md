Dragon v0.8
======

A collection of shaders for the Minecraft Shaders Mod.

Useage
======

To use these shaders, make a folder in your shaderpacks directory called "Dragon". Create a folder within that called "shaders". Copy all the .vsh and .fsh files from this repository into the shaders folder. Open Minecraft and be awed by how well I can program.

When you first run these shaders, you probably won't be too impressed because there's no normalmap in the default texture pack, and because there are no texture packs which provide all the data Dragon needs. I'm working on one such pack, and I'm going to try to talk some established texture pack authors into providing the data Dragon needs in their texture packs.

Features
======

- Normalmap support
- Shadows with varying softness
- Reflections calculated for every object
- Metals are properly shiny
- Everything has fresnel, which is good
- Motion blur, because it looks nice
- Vingette
- 25 FPS on a Nvidia GTX 660

Planned Features for v1.0
======

- Water waves for great graphics
- Better shadowing algorithm

Planned features for v2.0
======

- Film grain (once I get a good random function)
- Water and glass refraction
