DethRaid's Awesome Graphics On Nitro (DRAGON) has a number of cool features. Here they are, enumerated so I don't forget them:

- Physically Based Rendering through the whole pipeline
- Physically Based soft shadows with constants for the PCSS equations chosen to reflect the values present for the sun
- Dynamically rendered, physically based skybox used for all lighting
- Volumetric atmospheric fog which uses the shadow map to determine light occlusion
- Monte-Carlo reflections, optimized as highly as possible
- Raytraced block lighting
- Water waves based on the Gerstner equations
- Dynamic wind which impacts the water waves
- Volumetric clouds, rendered to get lighting from the skybox
    - Clouds start at block 256
    - Cloud opacity factors into shadows: shadows get blurrier when the sun is behind a partially transparent cloud
- Metalness-based PBR to conserve data
- GLSL version 450 to get access to all the new functions for things like compressing bits
- Physically based global illumination
- Specular lighting calculated on all the points that a ray hits, allowing for both the specular and diffuse light to bounce
- Raytracing against both the gbuffer and shadow buffers
- POM, outputting an offset depth value to the depth buffer
- Anti-aliasing
- Heavy use of #include to reduce code duplication
    - Visual Studio Code extension to handle that?
- Proper handling of rain and snow
    - During rain, blocks get wet, starting with the tops of the blocks and moving down to the bottom
    - During snow, the tops of the blocks get covered in snow, which then melts
    - A world-space noise texture is used to determine which parts are covered by an atmospheric effect

Things that happen in each file:
- gbuffers_terrain (and similar files)
    - read material parameters:
        - albedo (colortex4) (ldr)
        - roughness, metalness, emission, texture AO (colortex5) (ldr)
            - emission and metalness could be stored in one channel
                - metalness in one bit, emission in the other seven
        - normals (colortex6) (ldr)
            - normals are be stored in two channels
- gbuffers_water
    - Read material parameters 
        - Same schema as gbuffers_terrain
    - Dynamic waves
        - Directly modify vertex positions
        - Directly modify water normals and depth (for POM from small-scale waves)
- composite
    - Skybox generation (full resolution) (colortex2) (hdr)
- composite1
    - Volumetric clouds (full resolution, get lighting from skybox) (colortex0)
        - Full skybox is output to colortex0
        - skybox has atmospheric color (which implicitly includes brightness) in RGB and cloud opacity in A
    - Raytraced block lighting (half resolution) (colortex1) (hdr) (Upper left)
    - Global illumination (half resolution) (colortex1) (hdr) (Lower right)
        - GI exists here because I want to use the skybox for lighting, so I need the skybox before I can use it
    - Volumetric lighting (half resolution) (colortex1) (hdr) (Lower left)
        - TODO: When we're mixing the atmosphere in, we'll have to check for sky pixels. If we have a sky pixel, use 
            the sky at full strength. If not, mix in regularly
- composite2
    - Diffuse lighting (full resolution) (colortex0) (hdr)
    - Shadows (full resolution) (colortex4) (ldr)
- composite3
    - Specular lighting (full resolution) (colortex3) (hdr)
- composite4
    - Combine diffuse and specular light (colortex0) (hdr)
- composite5
    - Tonemapping, HDR bloom (colortex1) (ldr)
- final
    - Lens flare, anti-aliasing (screen) (ldr)
